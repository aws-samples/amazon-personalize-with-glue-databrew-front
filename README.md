# Overview
 This demo provides how to adopt personalized service on your web sites using AWS services. [Amazon Personailze](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/?nc1=h_ls) provides personalized recommendation model so all you need to do is preparing the data. Although Amazon Personalize provides good recipe, good data is crucial for good recommendation model. However, preparing quality of data set is complicated job. It is more complicated if you want to build "real-time" recommendation service by capturing click stream. 
 
 This demo guides not only how to use Amazon Personalize but how to prepare data set and adopt to your web-site. Moreover, we will feed user click stream so that we could provide [real-time recommendation service using Amazon Personalize](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/getting-real-time-recommendations.html). The demo provides sample movie recommendation web site. Our goal is adopting movie recommendation service using Amazon Personalize. Before that, we will process our sample movie data using [AWS Glue DataBrew](https://aws.amazon.com/ko/glue/features/databrew/).
